# Barcode matching App

Simple app that accepts 2 inputs and compares their values.  A confirmation/denial
message is provided based on outcome.

This app was written for anatomical pathology lab's grossing process for the
grosser to confirm that the barcode on the bottle where tissue was being
extracted from matched the cassette the tissue was being put into.
